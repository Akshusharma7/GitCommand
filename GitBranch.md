# BRANCH

### Branching:
> Timeline of commits, by default branch is master, we can create several branch from master branch

### Merge:
> Merge other branch to master

### Fast forward merge:
> Simplest case, like never branched , commits on destination, can be disabled

### Automatic merge:
> Non-conflicting merge detected, preserves both timelines, merge commit on destination

#### Manual Merge:
> Automatic merge not possible, conflicting merge state, changes saved in merge commit
